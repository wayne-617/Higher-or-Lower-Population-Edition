# Higher or Lower Population Edition
Inspiration
The project was inspired by a popular game called "Higher or Lower" where two topics are shown and you have to guess whether it has higher or lower searches than the other. This project recreates it using population data as the comparison.

## How it was built
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and REST Countries API

## What it does
It uses the REST countries API to gather the data on each country's population, and uses a random generator to pick out two countries. On a correct answer, a new country is drawn and is compared to the previous one while your score increases. This continues until there is an incorrect answer which ends the game, giving the player the option to return to the main menu or restart.
